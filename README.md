The case study revolves around a small town utility (Vermon City Electric) which tries to lower the cost of providing electricity.
The utility has implemented demand side management (DSM) to curtail energy demand. 
Due to an economic downturn the utility was forced to cut spending and now tries to reevaluate the DSM program. 
Given specific options and demand profiles the student has to construct a linear programming model to find the optimal solution. 

All details about the case can be found in the [PDF file](https://github.com/bhammeri/vermont-case-study/blob/master/Vermont_Electric.pdf). 

The linear model is implemented as an abstract model using Pyomo. The raw data is loaded dynamically from this [file](https://github.com/bhammeri/vermont-case-study/blob/master/vermont_city_with_dsm_emission_cap.dat).
